<h2>Hunting</h2>
Resica Falls offers a growing hunting program as part of our conservation efforts. Interested hunters provide service to the camp, as well as a hunting permit fee, with access to hunt on the property during select seasons. A PA State Game license is also required. For seasons, pricing, and more information, contact our Ranger Nick McKee.

<h2>Fishing</h2>
The Bushkill Creek at Resica Falls is one of the leading fly fishing areas on the East Coast of the United States. Cradle of Liberty Council, BSA offers anglers the opportunity to fish on a six-mile stretch of the Bushkill Creek. NOTE: No fishing within 200 yards above and below the actual Falls is permitted.

A PA State fishing license is required and all state and local regulations must be followed. We suggest a donation of $30 for your fly fishing experience at Resica Falls. In addition, we also offer the opportunity to perpetuate the cooperative Nursery program for $40. This helps the camp cover the operating cost of the hatchery each year. The PA Fish and Boat Commission supply fish for stocking in April and fingerlings each June for the hatchery to be released the following spring.

<strong>Important Notes:</strong>
- Resica Falls Fishing Permit is valid from January 1 to December 31 of the current year.
- PA State Fishing License is also required.
- Valid only for 6 miles of the Bushkill Creek located on Resica Falls Scout Reservation.
