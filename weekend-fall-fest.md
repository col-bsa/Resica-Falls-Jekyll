The Musser camping experience is not just a summer thing. Throughout the autumn, we host Fall Fest - a day-long program that keeps the adventure of Cub Scouting and Cub Camp happening for the whole family! All participants will experience a wide array of activities to give a just a taste of what the summer camp program opportunities have to offer. The program is offered in a newly redesigned open program format. All programs areas are open throughout the day - 9am to 3pm - where you, your family, or your Pack decide what to do and when to do it. Activities are designed for Cubs of all levels and abilities, and may include: Archery shooting, BB gun shooting, Slingshots, Apple Chucking, BMX Bikes, Bouldering, Crafts and Pumpkin Carving, Drone Flying, Scout Skills, and more family fun!

All participants receive lunch with your registration. Along with the open program format, you choose when you want lunch as well. Served between 11am & 1pm, you decide where you eat our cafeteria style lunch. All Scouts will also receive a Fall Fest patch. You donâ€™t want to miss out on the magic Musser has to offer all year long.
