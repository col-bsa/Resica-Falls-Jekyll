Dear Cub Scout Families,

For most Scouts, summer camp is the highlight of the Scouting year. With that in mind, key volunteers across several council committees, along with the summer camp and council leadership teams, have spent a tremendous amount of time and effort monitoring updates and projections by several government, Scouting, and camping organizations from the local to national levels. The goal was to seek a path forward to be able to conduct our summer programs in a manner that will keep our Scouts and leaders safe, maintaining our council's unwavering commitment to the well-being of our members. 

Regrettably, we have come to the difficult decision to cancel all in-person summer camp operations for 2020. This decision was not arrived at lightly, but it is aligned with and supports the council's ongoing commitment to the safety of our Scouts and leaders above all else. Knowing how important an outdoor experience is to our youth, we will continue to monitor state and local guidance with the hope of being able to offer small-group gatherings later in the summer.

Work has now begun on creating virtual summer experiences for our Cubs to keep them connected to friends and fellow Cub Scouts. Be sure to visit [www.colbsa.org/homescouting](https://colbsa.org/homescouting) for some exciting programs and virtual experiences presented by some of your favorite Cub Camp staff! You will likely have many questions about this decision. We stand-ready to answer questions, a a full FAQ will be posted to [www.colbsa.org/coronavirus](https://colbsa.org/coronavirus). If you have questions in the mean-time - for program questions, please reach-out to [Jason Burns Jason.Burns@scouting.org](mailto:Jason.Burns@scouting.org), and for refund questions, please reach-out to [Tracy Launders at Tracy.Launders@scouting.org](mailto:Tracy.Launders@scouting.org). For general questions about Cradle of Liberty Camping operations, feel free to reach-out to [John Bickel at John.Bickel@scouting.org](mailto:John.Bickel@scouting.org) or (484) 614-2370.

While this is not how any of us expected the summer of 2020 to go, the volunteers and staff of the Cradle of Liberty Council remain committed to providing programs to help you and your Scouts make the most of these unprecedented times. We remain hopeful that we will be able to provide small-group programs later in the summer as government guidelines allows, and we eagerly look ahead to the incredible line up of fall programs that are planned! Until then, please stay healthy and safe and we hope to see you soon along the virtual trail.  

Yours in Scouting,

Dan Templar
