Whether you are looking for Day Camp, Weekends in the woods with your family and Pack, or a Full-Week of overnight camp, Musser Scout Reservation has something to ensure every Cub Scout has a summer of adventure! 

With program offerings including boating, Nature, STEM, bouldering, pool, BB's, Archery, and MUCH more; your Cub Scout will have a great time in the outdoors learning new skills, building confidence, and earning advancement.

Day camp is perfect for Cubs who want to come to camp but aren't ready to spend the night in camp. The Weekend Overnighters are great for families and Packs who want an overnight experience, but can't take-off for a whole week. And the Full-Week Overnight camp is perfect for families and Packs that want the full camp experience!

We are excited to see your Cubs in camp, so be sure to [sign-up today!](/summer/register)
