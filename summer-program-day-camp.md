excerpt: Day Camp is a perfect program for younger Scouts and Scouts who want more Scouting programs without the overnight component.

Day Camp at Musser is a week-long, Monday through Friday program. Program begins at 9am each day and ends at 4pm each day. Lunch is provided for all day campers each day and [bussing is available from different locations](/summer/bus) throughout the council each week. Day Camp is a perfect program for those younger Scouts who are not quite ready for [Weekend Overnight Camp](/summer/weekend-overnight) or [Full-Week Overnight Camp](/summer/full-week-overnight), or for those Cubs who want more Scouting programs without the overnight component. We recommend Day Camp for Tigers through Bears (1st - 3rd graders).

**NEW FOR 2020** - For those parents who need to drop their Scouts off early, or pick up your Scouts a little later, we will be offering before and after care. There will be an additional fee of $50 for 7:30am drop-off or 6:00pm pick-up. For both early drop-off and late pick-up there is a fee of $75. When registering you Cub for camp, select the early drop-off or late pick-up option to take full advantage of this new opportunity!
