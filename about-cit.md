CITs, or Counselors in Training, are the future of camp staff. As 14 or 15 year old scouts, there is the opportunity to participate in this awesome program. Many of the “scouting greats” were once CITs. CITs spend half the day gaining experience in a program area, and then the other half day is open for working on merit badges, exploring camp, or just hanging out with some friends. 

Qualifications of a Counselor in Training:

- Be either 14 or 15 years old by June 1st
- Commit to at least two weeks of campers and our staff set-up week
- A desire to have fun and make a lasting impact on the life of a scout
- A willingness to live by the Scout Oath &amp; Law
